// Routes are where the real action happens in any Express app
// They dictact what happens when a user visits a particular URL
// The ./routes/users.js file will contain all of the routes related to users functionality
// You could easily put all your login in in the main server.js file but keeping your routes in separate purpose-based files is a good idea
